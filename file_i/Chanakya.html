            <b> Buddhist version:<br></b>
            The legend of Chanakya and Chandragupta is detailed in the Pali-language Buddhist chronicles of Sri Lanka.
            It is not mentioned in Dipavamsa, the oldest of these chronicles.[11] The earliest Buddhist source to
            mention the legend is Mahavamsa, which is generally dated between fifth and sixth centuries CE.
            Vamsatthappakasini (also known as Mahvamsa Tika), a commentary on Mahavamsa, provides some more details
            about the legend. Its author is unknown, and it is dated variously from sixth century CE to 13th century
            CE.[12] Some other texts provide additional details about the legend; for example, the Maha-Bodhi-Vamsa and
            the Atthakatha give the names of the nine Nanda kings said to have preceded Chandragupta.[11][13]

            <p><b> Jain version:<br></b>
                The Chandragupta-Chanakya legend is mentioned in several commentaries of the Shvetambara canon. The most
                well-known version of the Jain legend is contained in the Sthaviravali-Charita or Parishishta-Parvan,
                written by the 12th-century writer Hemachandra.[1] Hemachandra's account is based on the Prakrit
                kathanaka literature (legends and anecdotes) composed between the late first century CE and mid-8th
                century CE. These legends are contained in the commentaries (churnis and tikas) on canonical texts such
                as Uttaradhyayana and Avashyaka Niryukti.[14]
                Thomas Trautmann believes that the Jain version is older and more consistent than the Buddhist version
                of the legend.[14]

                Sanskrit collections of legends. Both are based on a now-lost Prakrit-language Brihatkatha-Sarit-Sagara.
                It was based on the now-lost Paishachi-language Brihatkatha by Gunadhya. The Chanakya-Chandragupta

                <b> Mudrarakshasa version:<br></b>
                Mudrarakshasa ("The signet ring of Rakshasa") is a Sanskrit play by Vishakhadatta. Its date is
                uncertain, but it mentions the Huna, who invaded northern India during the Gupta period. Therefore, it
                could not have been composed before the Gupta era.[16] It is dated variously from the late fourth
                century[17] to the eighth century.[18] The Mudrarakshasa legend contains narratives not found in other
                versions of the Chanakya-Chandragupta legend. Because of this difference, Trautmann suggests that most
                of it is fictional or legendary, without any historical basis.[19

                Identification with Kauṭilya or Vishnugupta
                See also:<b> Arthashastra § Authorship</b>
                The ancient Arthashastra has been traditionally attributed to Chanakya by a number of scholars. The
                Arthashastra identifies its author as Kauṭilya, a gotra or clan name, except for one verse that refers
                to him by the personal name of Vishnugupta.[20] Kauṭilya is presumably the name of the author's gotra
                (clan).[21]

                One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta explicitly was the
                Panchatantra.[22][need quotation to verify]

                K. C. Ojha proposes that the traditional identification of Vishnugupta with Kauṭilya was caused by a
                confusion of the text's editor and its originator. He suggests that Vishnugupta was a redactor of the
                original work of Kauṭilya.[3] Thomas Burrow suggests that Chanakya and Kauṭilya may have been two
                different people.[23]

                Dhana Nanda's empire, circa 323 BCE
                Jain version
                According to the Jain account, Chanakya was born to two lay Jains (shravaka) named Chanin and
                Chaneshvari. His birthplace was the Chanaka village in Golla vishaya (region).[1] The identity of
                "Golla" is not certain, but Hemachandra states that Chanakya was a Dramila, implying that he was a
                native of South India.[24]

                Chanakya was born with a full set of teeth. According to the monks, this was a sign that he would become
                a king in the future. Chanin did not want his son to become haughty, so he broke Chanakya's teeth. The
                monks prophesied that the baby would go on to become a power behind the throne.[1] Chanakya grew up to
                be a learned shravaka, and married a Brahmin woman. Her relatives mocked her for being married to a poor
                man. This motivated Chanakya to visit Pataliputra, and seek donations from the king Nanda, who was
                famous for his generosity towards Brahmins. While waiting for the king at the royal court, Chanakya sat
                on the king's throne. A dasi (servant girl) courteously offered Chanakya the next seat, but Chanakya
                kept his kamandal (water pot) on it, while remaining seated on the throne. The servant offered him a
                choice of four more seats, but each time, he kept his various items on the seats, refusing to budge from
                the throne. Finally, the annoyed servant kicked him off the throne. Enraged, Chanakya vowed to uproot
                Nanda and his entire establishment, like "a great wind uproots a tree".[25]

                Chanakya knew that he was prophesied to become a power behind the throne. So, he started searching for a
                person worthy of being a king. While wandering, he did a favour for the pregnant daughter of a village
                chief, on the condition that her child would belong to him. Chandragupta was born to this lady. When
                Chandragupta grew up, Chanakya came to his village and saw him playing "king" among a group of boys. To
                test him, Chanakya asked him for a donation. The boy told Chanakya to take the cows nearby, declaring
                that nobody would disobey his order. This display of power convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta was the
                one worthy of being a king.[1]

                Chanakya took Chandragupta to conquer Pataliputra, the capital of Nanda. He assembled an army using the
                wealth he had acquired through alchemy (dhatuvada-visaradan). The army suffered a severe defeat, forcing
                Chanakya and Chandragupta to flee the battlefield. They reached a lake while being pursued by an enemy
                officer. Chanakya asked Chandragupta to jump into the lake, and disguised himself as a meditating
                ascetic. When the enemy soldier reached the lake, he asked the 'ascetic' if he had seen Chandragupta.
                Chanakya pointed at the lake. As the soldier removed his armour to jump into the lake, Chanakya took his
                sword and killed him. When Chandragupta came out of the water, Chanakya asked him, "What went through
                your mind, when I disclosed your location to the enemy?" Chandragupta replied that he trusted his master
                to make the best decision. This convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta would remain under his influence
                even after becoming the king. On another occasion, Chanakya similarly escaped the enemy by chasing away
                a washerman, and disguising himself as one. Once, he cut open the belly of a Brahmin who had just eaten
                food, and took out the food to feed a hungry Chandragupta.[26]

                One day, Chanakya and Chandragupta overheard a woman scolding her son. The child had burnt his finger by
                putting it in the middle of a bowl of hot gruel. The woman told her son that by not starting from the
                cooler edges, he was being foolish like Chanakya, who attacked the capital before conquering the
                bordering regions. Chanakya realized his mistake, and made a new plan to defeat Nanda. He formed an
                alliance with Parvataka, the king of a mountain kingdom called Himavatkuta, offering him half of Nanda's
                kingdom.[26]

                After securing Parvataka's help, Chanakya and Chandragupta started besieging the towns other than
                Pataliputra. One particular town offered a strong resistance. Chanakya entered this town disguised as a
                Shaivite mendicant, and declared that the siege would end if the idols of the seven mothers were removed
                from the town's temple. As soon as the superstitious defenders removed the idols from the temple,
                Chanakya ordered his army to end the siege. When the defenders started celebrating their victory,
                Chanakya's army launched a surprise attack and captured the town.[26]

                Gradually, Chanakya and Chandragupta subdued all the regions outside the capital. Finally, they captured
                Pataliputra and Chandragupta became the king. They allowed the king Nanda to go into exile, with all the
                goods he could take on a cart. As Nanda and his family were leaving the city on a cart, his daughter saw
                Chandragupta, and fell in love with the new king. She chose him as her husband by svayamvara tradition.
                As she was getting off the cart, 9 spokes of the cart's wheel broke. Interpreting this as an omen,
                Chanakya declared that Chandragupta's dynasty would last for 9 generations.[26]

                Meanwhile, Parvataka fell in love with one of Nanda's visha kanyas (poison girl). Chanakya approved the
                marriage, and Parvataka collapsed when he touched the girl during the wedding. Chanakya asked
                Chandragupta not to call a physician. Thus, Parvataka died and Chandragupta became the sole ruler of
                Nanda's territories.[27]

                Chanakya then started consolidating the power by eliminating Nanda's loyalists, who had been harassing
                people in various parts of the kingdom. Chanakya learned about a weaver who would burn any part of his
                house infested with cockroaches. Chanakya assigned the responsibility of crushing the rebels to this
                weaver. Soon, the kingdom was free of insurgents. Chanakya also burned a village that had refused him
                food in the past. He filled the royal treasury by inviting rich merchants to his home, getting them
                drunk and gambling with a loaded dice.[27]

                Once, the kingdom suffered a 12-year long famine. Two young Jain monks started eating from the king's
                plate, after making themselves invisible with a magic ointment. Chanakya sensed their presence by
                covering the palace floor with a powder, and tracing their footprints. At the next meal, he caught them
                by filling the dining room with thick smoke, which caused the monks' eyes to water, washing off the
                ointment. Chanakya complained about the young monks behavior to the head monk Acharya Susthita. The
                Acharya blamed people for not being charitable towards monks, so Chanakya started giving generous alms
                to the monks.[27]

                Meanwhile, Chandragupta had been patronizing the non-Jain monks. Chanakya decided to prove to him that
                these men were not worthy of his patronage. He covered the floor of the palace area near the women's
                rooms with a powder, and left the non-Jain monks there. Their footprints showed that they had sneaked up
                to the windows of the women's rooms to peep inside. The Jain monks, who were assessed using the same
                method, stayed away from the women's rooms. After seeing this, Chandragupta appointed the Jain monks as
                his spiritual counsellors.[28]

                Chanakya used to mix small doses of poison in Chandragupta's food to make him immune to poisoning
                attempts. The king, unaware of this, once shared his food with Queen Durdhara. Chanakya entered the room
                at the instant she died. He cut open the dead queen's belly and took out the baby. The baby, who had
                been touched by a drop ("bindu") of the poison, was named Bindusara.[28]

                After Chandragupta abdicated the throne to become a Jain monk, Chanakya anointed Bindusara as the new
                king.[28] Chanakya asked Bindusara to appoint a man named Subandhu as one of his ministers. However,
                Subandhu wanted to become a higher minister and grew jealous of Chanakya. So, he told Bindusara that
                Chanakya was responsible for the death of his mother. Bindusara confirmed the allegations with the
                nurses, who told him that Chanakya had cut open the belly of his mother. And enraged Bindusara started
                hating Chanakya. As a result, Chanakya, who had grown very old by this time, retired and decided to
                starve himself to death. Meanwhile, Bindusara came to know about the detailed circumstances of his
                birth, and implored Chanakya to resume his ministerial duties. After failing to pacify Chanakya, the
                emperor ordered Subandhu to convince Chanakya to give up his suicide plan. Subandhu, while pretending to
                appease Chanakya, burned him to death. Subandhu then took possession of Chanakya's home. Chanakya had
                anticipated this, and before retiring, he had set up a cursed trap for Subandhu. He had left behind a
                chest with a hundred locks. Subandhu broke the locks, hoping to find precious jewels. He found a
                sweet-smelling perfume and immediately inhaled it. But then his eyes fell on a birch bark note with a
                curse written on it. The note declared that anybody who smelled this perfume will have to either become
                a monk or face death. Subandhu tested the perfume on another man, and then fed him luxurious food
                (something that the monks abstain from). The man died, and then Subandhu was forced to become a monk to
                avoid death.[29][30]

                According to another Jain text – the Rajavali-Katha – Chanakya accompanied Chandragupta to forest for
                retirement, once Bindusara became the king.[31]

                <b> Buddhist version:<br></b>
                According to the Buddhist legend, the Nanda kings who preceded Chandragupta were
                robbers-turned-rulers.[11] Chanakya (IAST: Cāṇakka in Mahavamsa) was a Brahmin from Takkāsila
                (Takshashila). He was well-versed in three Vedas and politics. He had canine teeth, which were believed
                to be a mark of royalty. His mother feared that he would neglect her after becoming a king.[2] To pacify
                her, Chanakya broke his teeth.[32]

                Chanakya was said to be ugly, accentuated by his broken teeth and crooked feet. One day, the king Dhana
                Nanda organized an alms-giving ceremony for Brahmins. Chanakya went to Pupphapura (Pushpapura) to attend
                this ceremony. Disgusted by his appearance, the king ordered him to be thrown out of the assembly.
                Chanakya broke his sacred thread in anger, and cursed the king. The king ordered his arrest, but
                Chanakya escaped in the disguise of an Ājīvika. He befriended Dhananada's son Pabbata, and instigated
                him to seize the throne. With help of a signet ring given by the prince, Chanakya fled the palace
                through a secret door.[32]

                Chanakya escaped to the Vinjha forest. There, he made 800 million gold coins (kahapanas), using a secret
                technique that allowed him to turn 1 coin into 8 coins. After hiding this money, he started searching
                for a person worthy of replacing Dhana Nanda.[32] One day, he saw a group of children playing: the young
                Chandragupta (called Chandagutta in Mahavamsa) played the role of a king, while other boys pretended to
                be vassals, ministers, or robbers. The "robbers" were brought before Chandragupta, who ordered their
                limbs to be cut off, but then miraculously re-attached them. Chandragupta had been born in a royal
                family, but was brought up by a hunter after his father was killed by an usurper, and the devatas caused
                his mother to abandon him. Astonished by the boy's miraculous powers, Chanakya paid 1000 gold coins to
                his foster-father, and took Chandragupta away, promising to teach him a trade.[33]

                Chanakya had two potential successors to Dhana Nanda: Pabbata and Chandragupta. He gave each of them an
                amulet to be worn around the neck with a woolen thread. One day, he decided to test them. While
                Chandragupta was asleep, he asked Pabbata to remove Chandragupta's woolen thread without breaking it and
                without waking up Chandragupta. Pabbata failed to accomplish this task. Some time later, when Pabbata
                was sleeping, Chanakya challenged Chandragupta to complete the same task. Chandragupta retrieved the
                woolen thread by cutting off Pabbata's head. For the next seven years, Chanakya trained Chandragupta for
                royal duties. When Chandragupta became an adult, Chanakya dug up his hidden treasure of gold coins, and
                assembled an army.[33]

                The army of Chanadragupta and Chanakya invaded Dhana Nanda's kingdom, but disbanded after facing a
                severe defeat. While wandering in disguise, the two men once listened to the conversation between a
                woman and her son. The child had eaten the middle of a cake, and thrown away the edges. The woman
                scolded him, saying that he was eating food like Chandragupta, who attacked the central part of the
                kingdom instead of conquering the border villages first. Chanakya and Chandragupta realized their
                mistake. They assembled a new army, and started conquering the border villages. Gradually, they advanced
                to the kingdom's capital Pataliputra (Pāṭaliputta in Mahavamsa), where they killed the king Dhana Nanda.
                Chanakya ordered a fisherman to find the place where Dhana Nanda had hidden his treasure. As soon as the
                fishermen informed Chanakya about its location, Chanakya had him killed. Chanakya anointed Chandragupta
                as the new king, and tasked a man named Paṇiyatappa with eliminating rebels and robbers from the
                kingdom.[34]

                Chanakya started mixing small doses of poison in the new king's food to make him immune to poisoning
                attempts by the enemies. Chandragupta, who was not aware of this, once shared the food with his pregnant
                queen, who was seven days away from delivery. Chanakya arrived just as the queen ate the poisoned
                morsel. Realizing that she was going to die, Chanakya decided to save the unborn child. He cut off the
                queen's head and cut open her belly with a sword to take out the foetus. Over the next seven days, he
                placed the foetus in the belly of a goat freshly killed each day. After seven days, Chandragupta's son
                was "born". He was named Bindusara, because his body was spotted with drops (bindu) of goat's blood.[34]

                The earliest Buddhist legends do not mention Chanakya in their description of the Mauryan dynasty after
                this point.[33] Dhammapala's commentary on Theragatha, however, mentions a legend about Chanakya and a
                Brahmin named Subandhu. According to this account, Chanakya was afraid that the wise Subandhu would
                surpass him at Chandragupta's court. So, he got Chandragupta to imprison Subandhu, whose son
                Tekicchakani escaped and became a Buddhist monk.[35] The 16th-century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha
                mentions Chanakya as one of Bindusara's "great lords". According to him, Chanakya destroyed the nobles
                and kings of 16 towns and made Bindusara the master of all the territory between the eastern and the
                western seas (Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal).[36]

                <b> Kashmiri version:<br></b>
                The Kashmiri version of the legend goes like this: Vararuchi (identified with Katyayana), Indradatta and
                Vyadi were three disciples of the sage Varsha. Once, on behalf of their guru Varsha, they traveled to
                Ayodhya to seek a gurudakshina (guru's fee) from king Nanda. As they arrived to meet Nanda, the king
                died. Using his yogic powers, Indradatta entered Nanda's body, and granted Vararuchi's request for 10
                million dinars (gold coins). The royal minister Shakatala realized what was happening, and had
                Indradatta's body burnt. But before he could take any action against the fake king (Indradatta in
                Nanda's body, also called Yogananda), the king had him arrested. Shakatala and his 100 sons were
                imprisoned, and were given food sufficient only for one person. Shakatala's 100 sons starved to death,
                so that their father could live to take revenge.[37]

                Meanwhile, the fake king appointed Vararuchi as his minister. As the king's character kept
                deteriorating, a disgusted Vararuchi retired to a forest as an ascetic. Shakatala was then restored as
                the minister, but kept planning his revenge. One day, Shakatala came across Chanakya, a Brahmin who was
                uprooting all the grass in his path, because one blade of the grass had pricked his foot. Shakatala
                realized that he could use a man so vengeful to destroy the fake king. He invited Chanakya to the king's
                assembly, promising him 100,000 gold coins for presiding over a ritual ceremony.[37]

                Shakatala hosted Chanakya in his own house, and treated him with great respect. But the day Chanakya
                arrived at the king's court, Shakatala got another Brahmin named Subandhu to preside over the ceremony.
                Chanakya felt insulted, but Shakatala blamed the king for this dishonour. Chanakya then untied his
                topknot (sikha), and vowed not to re-tie it until the king was destroyed. The king ordered his arrest,
                but he escaped to Shakatala's house. There, using materials supplied by Shakatala, he performed a magic
                ritual which made the king sick. The king died of fever after 7 days.[38]

                Shakatala then executed Hiranyagupta, the son of the fake king. He anointed Chandragupta, the son of the
                real king Nanda, as the new king (in Kshemendra's version, it is Chanakya who installs Chandragupta as
                the new king). Shakatala also appointed Chanakya as the royal priest (purohita). Having achieved his
                revenge, he then retired to the forest as an ascetic.[38]

                <b> Mudrarakshasa version:<br></b>
                According to the Mudrarakshasa version, the king Nanda once removed Chanakya from the "first seat of the
                kingdom" (this possibly refers to Chanakya's expulsion from the king's assembly). For this reason,
                Chanakya vowed not to tie his top knot (shikha) until the complete destruction of Nanda. Chanakya made a
                plan to dethrone Nanda, and replace him with Chandragupta, his son by a lesser queen. Chanakya
                engineered Chandragupta's alliance with another powerful king Parvateshvara (or Parvata), and the two
                rulers agreed to divide Nanda's territory after subjugating him. Their allied army included Bahlika,
                Kirata, Parasika, Kamboja, Shaka, and Yavana soldiers. The army invaded Pataliputra (Kusumapura) and
                defeated the Nandas.[39] Parvata is identified with King Porus by some scholars.[40]

                Nanda's prime minister Rakshasa escaped Pataliputra, and continued resisting the invaders. He sent a
                vishakanya (poison girl) to assassinate Chandragupta. Chanakya had this girl assassinate Parvata
                instead, with the blame going to Rakshasa. However, Parvata's son Malayaketu learned the truth about his
                father's death, and defected to Rakshasa's camp. Chanakya's spy Bhagurayana accompanied Malayaketu,
                pretending to be his friend.[41]

                Rakshasa continued to plot Chandragupta's death, but all his plans were foiled by Chanakya. For example,
                once Rakshasa arranged for assassins to be transported to Chandragupta's bedroom via a tunnel. Chanakya
                became aware of them by noticing a trail of ants carrying the leftovers of their food. He then arranged
                for the assassins to be burned to death.[42]

                Meanwhile, Parvata's brother Vairodhaka became the ruler of his kingdom. Chanakya convinced him that
                Rakshasa was responsible for killing his brother, and agreed to share half of Nanda's kingdom with him.
                Secretly, however, Chanakya hatched a plan to get Vairodhaka killed. He knew that the chief architect of
                Pataliputra was a Rakshasa loyalist. He asked this architect to build a triumphal arch for
                Chandragupta's procession to the royal palace. He arranged the procession to be held at midnight citing
                astrological reasons, but actually to ensure poor visibility. He then invited Vairodhaka to lead the
                procession on Chandragupta's elephant, and accompanied by Chandragupta's bodyguards. As expected,
                Rakshasa's loyalists arranged for the arch to fall on who they thought was Chandragupta. Vairodhaka was
                killed, and once again, the assassination was blamed on Rakshasa.[41]

                Malayaketu and Rakshasa then formed an alliance with five kings: Chiravarman of Kauluta (Kulu),
                Meghaksha of Parasika, Narasimha of Malaya, Pushkaraksha of Kashmira, and Sindhusena of Saindhava. This
                allied army also included soldiers from Chedi, Gandhara, Hunas, Khasa, Magadha, Shaka, and Yavana
                territories.[42]

                In Pataliputra, Chanakya's agent informed him that three Rakshasa loyalists remained in the capital: the
                Jain monk Jiva-siddhi, the scribe Shakata-dasa and the jewelers' guild chief Chandana-dasa. Of these,
                Jiva-siddhi was actually a spy of Chanakya, unknown to his other spies. Chandana-dasa sheltered
                Rakshasa's wife, who once unknowingly dropped her husband's signet-ring (mudra). Chanakya's agent got
                hold of this signet-ring, and brought it to Chanakya. Using this signet ring, Chanakya sent a letter to
                Malayaketu warning him that his allies were treacherous. Chanakya also asked some of Chandragupta's
                princes to fake defection to Malayaketu's camp. In addition, Chanakya ordered Shakata-dasa's murder, but
                had him 'rescued' by Siddharthaka, a spy pretending to be an agent of Chandana-dasa. Chanakya's spy then
                took Shakata-dasa to Rakshasa.[42]

                When Shakata-dasa and his 'rescuer' Siddharthaka reached Rakshasa, Siddharthaka presented him the
                signet-ring, claiming to have found it at Chandana-dasa's home. As a reward, Rakshasa gave him some
                jewels that Malayaketu had gifted him. Sometime after this, another of Chanakya's agents, disguised as a
                jeweler, sold Parvata's jewels to Rakshasa.[43]

                Sometime later, Rakshasa sent his spies disguised as musicians to Chandragupta's court. But Chanakya
                knew all about Rakshasa's plans thanks to his spies. In front of Rakshasa's spies, Chanakya and
                Chandragupta feigned an angry argument. Chandragupta pretended to dismiss Chanakya, and declared that
                Rakshasa would make a better minister. Meanwhile, Malayaketu had a conversation with Chanakya's spy
                Bhagurayana while approaching Rakshasa's house. Bhagurayana made Malayaketu distrustful of Rakshasa, by
                saying that Rakshasa hated only Chanakya, and would be willing to serve Nanda's son Chandragupta.
                Shortly after this, a messenger came to Rakshasa's house, and informed him that Chandragupta had
                dismissed Chanakya while praising him. This convinced Malayaketu that Rakashasa could not be
                trusted.[43]

                Malayaketu then decided to invade Pataliputra without Rakshasa by his side. He consulted the Jain monk
                Jiva-siddhi to decide an auspicious time for beginning the march. Jiva-siddhi, a spy of Chanakya, told
                him that he could start immediately.[43] Jiva-siddhi also convinced him that Rakshasa was responsible
                for his father's death, but Bhagurayana persuaded him not to harm Rakshasa. Shortly after, Chanakya's
                spy Siddharthaka pretended to get caught with a fake letter addressed to Chandragupta by Rakshasa.
                Wearing the jewels given by Rakshasa, he pretended to be an agent of Rakshasa. The letter, sealed with
                Rakshasa's signet-ring, informed Chandragupta that Rakshasa only wished to replace Chanakya as the prime
                minister. It also stated that five of Malayaketu's allies were willing to defect to Chandragupta in
                return for land and wealth. An angry Malayaketu summoned Rakshasa, who arrived wearing Parvata's jewels
                that Chanakya's agent had sold him. When Malayaketu saw Rakshasa wearing his father's jewels, he was
                convinced that there was indeed a treacherous plan against him. He executed his five allies in a brutal
                manner.[44]

                The rest of Malayaketu's allies deserted him, disgusted at his treatment of the five slayed allies.
                Rakshasa managed to escape, tracked by Chanakya's spies. One of Chanakya's spies, disguised as a friend
                of Chandana-dasa, got in touch with him. He told Rakshasa that Chandana-dasa was about to be executed
                for refusing to divulge the location of Rakshasa's family. On hearing this, Rakshasa rushed to
                Pataliputra to surrender and save the life of his loyal friend Chandana-dasa. When he reached
                Pataliputra, Chanakya, pleased with his loyalty to Chandana-dasa, offered him clemency. Rakshasa pledged
                allegiance to Chandragupta and agreed to be his prime minister, in return for release of Chandana-dasa
                and a pardon for Malayaketu. Chanakya then bound his top knot, having achieved his objective, and
                retired.[44]

                Two books are attributed to Chanakya: Arthashastra,[45] and Chanakya Niti, also known as Chanakya
                Neeti-shastra.[46] The Arthashastra was discovered in 1905 by librarian Rudrapatna Shamasastry in an
                uncatalogued group of ancient palm-leaf manuscripts donated by an unknown pandit to the Oriental
                Research Institute Mysore.[47]

                The Arthashastra, which discusses monetary and fiscal policies, welfare, international relations, and
                war strategies in detail. The text also outlines the duties of a ruler.[48][unreliable source?] Some
                scholars believe that Arthashastra is actually a compilation of a number of earlier texts written by
                various authors, and Chanakya might have been one of these authors (see above).[10]
                Chanakya Niti, which is a collection of aphorisms, said to be selected by Chanakya from the various

                - Shiv Shankar Menon, National Security Advisor[49]
                Chanakya is regarded as a great thinker and diplomat in India. Many Indian nationalists regard him as
                one of the earliest people who envisioned a united India spanning the entire subcontinent. India's
                former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon praised Chanakya's Arthashastra for its precise and
                timeless descriptions of power. Furthermore, he recommended reading of the book for broadening the
                vision on strategic issues.[49]

                half-brother Chandragupta, who joins the army of Alexander the Great. Later, with help from Chanakya and
